<p>  My hero, Michael Jordan was born on Febuary 16th, 1963. For college Jordan attended school at the University of North Carolina befor entering the NBA. Jordan was chosen as the 5-time most valuable player in the NBA and was also a 6-times finals mvp. Michael wa not alwys that good of a player. During his early years of highschool Jordan didnt start on his team. But he was an extrodinaraly hard worker and was able to push himself to the limits to become the player he was in his prime years, in the NBA.


<p>  Michael Jordan is my hero because of what he has accomplished. He has really made a name for himself throughout his basketball career, shoes, and his donations to charities. I think that it is amazing how much he had helped his community with the large amounts of money he donates. I had watched a docunmentery and it stated that he really wasn't a good basketball player until like junior year. He came from being one of the worst players on his team to arguale the best payer in the world. And over all he is just an insperation to me.
