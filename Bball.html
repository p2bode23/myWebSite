/*************** Algorithm ******************
1.Created my variables such as my questions and answers.
2.I started to create functions, displayQuestions, and the function to update answers.
3.I made Display question loop in order to loop through all of the questions.
4. The user submits there answer and hen sees if it is the same as the answer that the creator/me put.
5. The update score function will cheak the answer to see if they match up.
6. After the corect answer is shown after the user inputes there guess then it will answer if they are correct or not.
7. Then once the user looks to see if they are correct or not the cycle repeats itself.(restarts the algoritim)
