/*************** Algorithm ******************
1.Created my variables such as my questions and answers.
2.I started to create functions, displayQuestions, and the function to update answers.
3.I made Display question loop in order to loop through all of the questions.
4. The user submits there answer and hen sees if it is the same as the answer that the creator/me put.
5. The update score function will cheak the aswer to ee if they match up.
6. After the coorect answer is shown after the user inputes there guess then it will answer if they are correct or not.
7. Then once the user sees if they are correct or not the cycle repeats itself.(restarts the algoritim)

The checkAnswer will return a true or a false. If that function returns true, then the score variable will increase by 1, and an alert should pop up saying "Correct" or something positive. If the checkAnswer function comes back false, then score doesn't increase but an alert should announce "incorect." or something similar.
